## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Quote Flow (Leads Quality Update)

The `/quote` page now uses a new multi-step estimator flow designed to reduce low-intent ("junk") leads:

- Step 1: Origin and destination (city or ZIP, validated via autocomplete)
- Step 2: Vehicle type (sedan/coupe/suv/pickup/van/motorcycle) + trailer (Open/Enclosed)
- Step 3: Immediate estimated price, assumptions, and insights; options to request exact quote or to be contacted
- Step 4 (Exact path): Vehicle year/make/model + running status
- Step 5: Contact details and preferred pickup date

Key files:
- `src/components/forms/EstimatorQuote.tsx`: main UI flow
- `src/utils/priceEstimator.ts`: heuristic price estimator (distance bands + multipliers)
- `src/services/distance.ts`: geocoding & distance helpers + ETA window

Notes:
- Estimate assumes Open and runs/drives by default; choosing Enclosed adjusts pricing.
- Lead submission uses `sendLeadToLanding` and redirects to `/quote2`.
- To revert, swap the import in `src/pages/quote/index.astro` back to `FormQuote`.

## Roadbook blog and editor

The public blog is available at `/blog/`. Articles live in
`src/content/blog/*.md`, so Astro generates fast, indexable pages and includes
them in the sitemap. Each article supports state, tags, cover image, draft and
featured status, plus custom SEO title and description.

The editorial studio is available at `/admin/`. It publishes content and image
uploads directly to the `main` branch through the GitHub Contents API. A push
then triggers the existing GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

To sign in, create a fine-grained GitHub personal access token for the
`cayadservices/CayadServices` repository with only **Contents: Read and write**.
Paste it into the studio login. The token is kept only in JavaScript memory for
the current tab; it is not written to local storage, cookies, the repository,
or the built site.

Run the focused browser checks with:

```sh
python /home/carlos/.agents/skills/webapp-testing/scripts/with_server.py \
  --server "npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1" --port 4321 \
  -- python scripts/test_blog_ui.py
```
